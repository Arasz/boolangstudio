Who-coded-what in BooLangStudio:

* RegisterMsBuildTargetsAttribute class (in BooLangStudio project):
Based on the ProvideMSBuildTargetAttribute class in IronPython Studio, re-implemented by Jeff Olson

* ProjectBase stuff:
Source code linked from the Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 SDK ... I wish there were an easier way besides linking to the source, but this is the "pattern" they're forcing us to use.

* Boo deps:
Rodrigo B. de Oliveira and the Boo team

* Changes to BooLexer.cs (post-code generation from grammar) to make it play nice w/ an IDE by Jeff Olson
 
* Overload to BooParser.CreateBooLexer() by Jeff Olson

* Everything else (all original code), by the contributor(s) to BooLangStudio

Please let me know if anything is misattributed/anything is missing.

Thank you,
