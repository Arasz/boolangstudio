What BooLangStudio Has:
 * MsBuild integration in IDE (courtesy of the Boo team)
 * Basic syntax highlighting (with caveats noted below)
 * ClassLibrary and ConsoleApplication project types for boo
 * Basic empty Class and Text file ProjectItems for Boo
 * Auto-indentation when pressing enter after a ':' (colon) on the preceeding line

What BooLangStudio DOES NOT Have (but if you want to implement it, PLEASE DO):
 * Any form of IntelliSense, specifically:
  * member listing (when you press '.' after an instance identifier or Class identifier)
  * "declaration scope", where any objects/keywords in scope are displayed while typing
   * valid, "in-scope" types coming after the 'as' keyword. ie: "foo as <types displayed here>"
   * valid keywords by scope, ie: def, class, if, etc depending on scope/context
   * valid, in-scope local/member variables
  * tool tip support for types/method info
  * parameter info when constructing a method call
 * #region detection
 * 'comment-region' functionality
 * any refactoring functionality
 * resolve functionality

What BooLangStudio Has, But Needs Improvement On:
 * Currently, there are some aberrations with syntax highlighting, specifically:
  * multiline doc strings aren't parsed
  * multiline comments have some issues with the appears of multiline comments that contain string delimiters.. something with the way that BooScanner is dealing with tokens it receives, most likely.
