Intellisense stories

scopes for ctrl+space in whitespace (non-assignments)

namespace
{
  keywords

  class
  {
    [parent scope]
    types
    methods
    class member declarations
    
    method
    {
      [parent scope]
      local declarations
      
      inner scope
      {
        [parent scope]
        local declarations
      }
    }
  }
}

These are based on using C#, so the Boo implementation may vary but these
should be the starting point. I'd like to translate these into tests at
some point, but I'm not yet sure how to do that yet.

The following is a non-exhaustive list that I'll add to when I come across
more.

Type "using ":
  1. Hit control-space, intellisense pops up with top-level namespaces
  2. Start typing uses name completion
  3. Hit enter closes intellisense and inserts selection
  4. Hit "." opens up intellisense again with refined list
  5. Repeat from 2

Type "using ":
  1. Start typing namespace WITHOUT intellisense up, pops it up with name
     completion

Treat namespace keword as the same as using

If in method scope, or sub-scope (if statements etc):
  1. Hit control-space
  2. Show variables defined in scope
  3. Show fields, properties, and methods from the class scope
  4. Show classes from current namespace
  5. Show sub-classes declared in class
  6. Show classes from imported namespaces

Type assignment "x = ":
  1. Hit control-space
  2. Show same as method scope
  3. Show keywords (true, false etc)

If in class scope (between methods):
  1. Hit control-space
  2. Show keywords for methods
  3. Show classes in namespace
  4. Show sub-classes declared in class
  5. Show classes from imported namespaces
